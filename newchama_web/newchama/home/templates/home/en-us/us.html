<h4>Chamadao --- the Ancient Tea Horse Road</h4>

<p>From around a thousand years ago, the Ancient Tea Route was a trade link from Yunnan, one of the first tea-producing regions in China, toBengal via Burma; to Tibet; and to central China. The route earned the name Tea (Cha)-Horse (Ma) Road (Dao) because of the common trade of Tibetan ponies for Chinese tea, a practice dating back at least to the Song dynasty, when the sturdy horses were important for China to fight warring nomads in the north. It is believed that it was through this trading network that tea first spread across China and Asia from its origins...(From Wikipedia)</p>
